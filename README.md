# stock_analysis

**Overview of Project**
: The purpose of this analysis was to refactor an existing macro to optimize the code and allow the script to run faster and more efficiently.

**Results**
: Unfortunately, I had a good deal of issues refactoring the code with errors that seemed to pop up in different places after the previous error was corrected. For that reason, I can't provide updated screenshots of the refactored code running successfully. 

: I have included the original runtimes of the base code. Hoping that we can isolate the issue so I can learn what I was missing and update this assignment. I also noticed that while the script ran almost instantaneously, the seconds displayed in these screenshots appear to show much more time than what actually elapsed.

**Summary**
: In summary, it's great to refactor code as your knowledge of the subject/coding increases. This allows for the code to be more versatile, and use less computer resources while running. The downside, of course is that sometimes things can become overcomplicated, as I was unsuccessful in being able to refactor the existing code that was working to my expectations.
: These pros and cons apply 

Original Code
 **Pros**
 - Easier to interpret with less variables
 - Executed as expected

**Cons**
 - Was somewhat redundant, allowing lines of code to run each iteration that may not have needed to

Refactored code

**Pros**

 - Included nested loops, so executed code was minimized
 - Increased number of variables allowed for more flexibility

**Cons**
 - Additional variables sometimes made the code harder to interpret
